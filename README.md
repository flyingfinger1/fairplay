A Paper plugin for Minecraft 1.21.8 that enforces one simple rule:

> **You may only break blocks that you placed yourself.**

---

## Concept

Every block a player places is assigned to them in a database. Foreign blocks cannot be broken — not directly, and not indirectly. This creates a cooperative survival experience where resources and structures truly "belong" to a player.

The plugin supports two modes: **solo** (strict ownership, default) and **team** (shared ownership, restrictions disabled).

## Features

### Block Ownership
- Every placed block is registered to the player (SQLite database)
- Foreign blocks cannot be broken
- **Creative mode** bypasses all checks automatically
- Two-block structures (beds, doors, tall plants) are correctly treated as a unit
- **Gravity blocks** (sand, gravel, concrete powder, anvils …) retain their ownership when they fall and land at a new position

### Fluids & Resources
- Water and lava buckets can only be filled from the player's own sources
- Waterlogged blocks (e.g. fence in water) check for adjacent owned water sources
- Glass bottles can only be filled from the player's own water sources
- Cauldrons can only be emptied by the owner
- Crops can only be fertilised by the owner

### Plants & Growth
- Naturally grown blocks (sugar cane, cactus, bamboo, kelp …) inherit ownership from the base block
- Trees grown from the player's own saplings belong to the planter
- Sweet berries can only be harvested by the bush owner
- Farmland cannot be trampled by other players
- Dripstone tips that grow from an owned stalactite or stalagmite are assigned to the owner

### Mob Ownership
- Animals bred or tamed by a player are registered in the database
- Only the owner may shear sheep, milk cows, collect mushroom stew, and brush armadillos
- Wild animals (not bred/tamed) are blocked for everyone — they cannot be interacted with

### 28 Custom Advancements
The plugin ships its own advancement tree explaining and rewarding FairPlay mechanics — from "Foundation" (first own block) to "First Night" (surviving until dawn).

### Team / Solo Mode
Configure in `config.yml` whether players compete individually or share resources as a team:

```yaml
# solo  → each player only owns what they placed themselves (default)
# team  → all players share ownership, no restrictions apply
game-mode: solo
```

### Multilingual Support
All player messages and advancement texts are automatically displayed in the player's client language. Currently supported languages:
- 🇺🇸 English (`en_us`)
- 🇩🇪 German (`de_de`)
- 🇫🇷 French (`fr_fr`)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (`es_es`)
- 🇧🇷 Portuguese Brazil (`pt_br`)
- 🇮🇹 Italian (`it_it`)
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (`nl_nl`)
- 🇵🇱 Polish (`pl_pl`)
- 🇷🇺 Russian (`ru_ru`)
- 🇨🇳 Chinese Simplified (`zh_cn`)
- 🇯🇵 Japanese (`ja_jp`)
- 🇰🇷 Korean (`ko_kr`)

Adding a new language only requires adding a file to `src/main/resources/lang/` and `src/main/resources/resourcepack/assets/fairplay/lang/`.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Paper 1.21.8
- Java 21
- Internet access on first start (Paper downloads `sqlite-jdbc` from Maven Central automatically)

### Build
```bash
gradle build
```
The finished JAR is located in `build/libs/FairPlay-1.0.0.jar`.

### Configuration
After the first start, `plugins/FairPlay/config.yml` is created:

```yaml
# solo  → each player only owns what they placed themselves (default)
# team  → all players share ownership, no restrictions apply
game-mode: solo

# Resource pack (translations for advancements).
# On every start the plugin saves fairplay-resourcepack.zip to plugins/FairPlay/.
#
# Option A – External URL (recommended, e.g. GitHub Releases):
# resource-pack-url: https://github.com/YOUR_USER/FairPlay/releases/latest/download/fairplay-resourcepack.zip
#
# Option B – Embedded HTTP server (local/LAN only, no URL set):
resource-pack-host: localhost   # For a dedicated server: external IP or domain
resource-pack-port: 8765

# true  = clients must accept the pack (otherwise kicked)
# false = clients may decline (they will only see raw translation keys)
resource-pack-required: false
```

> **Resource pack hosting:** On every start the plugin writes `plugins/FairPlay/fairplay-resourcepack.zip`. Upload that file to GitHub Releases and set `resource-pack-url` — the embedded HTTP server is then not started. Without the pack, raw translation keys are displayed in advancements.
